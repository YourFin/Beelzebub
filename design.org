#+TITLE: Design

Client server - shove as much logic into client as possible

* Client
** MVP:
- Start process
- Find process
  + PID
  + Log file
- List running processes
** Later:
- restart semantics
* Server
** MVP:
- Runs as daemon
- puts process stdout and stderr into logs
- Query about running process
  + PID
  + Log file location
- Will start processes
** Later:
- Can send signals to children
- state monitoring
- Better logs
- hook on stdin
